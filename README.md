My accident detection and prevention system using Arduino is a well-rounded and practical project. Here's a step-by-step approach to building it, integrating all the sensors and modules you mentioned:

Components Required:

```1. Arduino (Uno/Nano/Mega)
2. Pulse Sensor – to monitor the driver’s heart rate.
3. MPU6050 (Accelerometer & Gyroscope) – to detect sudden changes in the vehicle's axis (tilt/jerk).
4. Sound Sensor – to monitor noise levels associated with collisions or crashes.
5. Vibration Sensor – to detect abnormal vibrations indicating an accident.
6. GSM Module (SIM900) – for sending SMS alerts.
7. GPS Module (Neo-6M) – to track the vehicle’s location.
8. Buzzer(Small buzzer) – for alarm or alerting the driver during risky conditions.
9. LCD Display (Optional) – to display status, heart rate, or alerts.
